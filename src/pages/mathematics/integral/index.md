## Integral

### What is an Integral?
- The opposite process of differentiation(derivatives) is known as the integral (anti- derivative). If a function g exists and it's 
derivative is G, then integral of G gives g.


### Types
- Indefinite Integral (anti-derivative)
- Definite Integral 

### Why Integrals?
- To find area under the curve, this finds use, especially in phyics where for example, area under the velocity-time curve gives
the displacement.
- Work done by a force can be calculated by taking the integral (i.e. area under the curve) of the Force function over the displacement.
